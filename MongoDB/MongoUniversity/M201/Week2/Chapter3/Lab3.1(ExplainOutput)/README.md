# Lab 3.1 Explain Output

## Problem

In this lab you're going to determine which index was used to satisfy a query given its explain output.

The following query was ran:

```sh
> var exp = db.restaurants.explain("executionStats")
> exp.find({ "address.state": "NY", stars: { $gt: 3, $lt: 4 } }).sort({ name: 1 }).hint(REDACTED)
```

Which resulted in the following output:

```
{
  "queryPlanner": {
    "plannerVersion": 1,
    "namespace": "m201.restaurants",
    "indexFilterSet": false,
    "parsedQuery": "REDACTED",
    "winningPlan": {
      "stage": "SORT",
      "sortPattern": {
        "name": 1
      },
      "inputStage": {
        "stage": "SORT_KEY_GENERATOR",
        "inputStage": {
          "stage": "FETCH",
          "inputStage": {
            "stage": "IXSCAN",
            "keyPattern": "REDACTED",
            "indexName": "REDACTED",
            "isMultiKey": false,
            "isUnique": false,
            "isSparse": false,
            "isPartial": false,
            "indexVersion": 1,
            "direction": "forward",
            "indexBounds": "REDACTED"
          }
        }
      }
    },
    "rejectedPlans": [ ]
  },
  "executionStats": {
    "executionSuccess": true,
    "nReturned": 3335,
    "executionTimeMillis": 20,
    "totalKeysExamined": 3335,
    "totalDocsExamined": 3335,
    "executionStages": "REDACTED"
  },
  "serverInfo": "REDACTED",
  "ok": 1
}
```

Given the redacted explain output above, select the index that was passed to hint.

Note: The hint() method is used to force the query planner to select a particular index for a given query. You can learn more about hint by visiting its documentation.
## Answer
{ "address.state": 1, "stars": 1, "name": 1 }
