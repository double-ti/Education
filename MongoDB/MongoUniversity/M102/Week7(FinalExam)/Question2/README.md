# Question 2

## Problem

Let's do that again with a slightly different crash/recover scenario for each process. Start with the following:

With all three members (mongod's) up and running, you should be fine; otherwise, delete your data directory, and, once again:

```
./a.sh
```
```
mongo --shell --port 27003 a.js
```
```
ourinit() // you might need to wait a bit after this.
// be sure 27003 is the primary.
// use rs.stepDown() elsewhere if it isn't.
```
```
db.foo.drop()
db.foo.insert( { _id : 1 }, { writeConcern : { w : 2 } } )
db.foo.insert( { _id : 2 }, { writeConcern : { w : 2 } } )
db.foo.insert( { _id : 3 }, { writeConcern : { w : 2 } } )
var a = connect("localhost:27001/admin");
a.shutdownServer()
rs.status()
db.foo.insert( { _id : 4 } )
db.foo.insert( { _id : 5 } )
db.foo.insert( { _id : 6 } )
```
Now this time, shut down the mongod on port 27003 (in addition to the other member being shut down already) before doing anything else. One way of doing this in Unix would be:
```
ps -A | grep mongod
# should see the 27003 and 27002 ones running (only)
ps ax | grep mongo | grep 27003 | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kill
# wait a little for the shutdown perhaps...then:
ps -A | grep mongod
# should get that just the arbiter is presentâ€¦
```
Now restart just the 27001 member. Wait for it to get healthy -- check this with rs.status() in the shell. Then query
```
> db.foo.find()
```
Then add another document:
```
> db.foo.insert( { _id : "last" } )
```
After this, restart the third set member (mongod on port 27003). Wait for it to come online and enter a health state (secondary or primary).

Run (on any member -- try multiple if you like) :
```
> db.foo.find()
```
You should see a difference from problem 1 in the result above.

Question: Which of the following are true about mongodb's operation in these scenarios? Check all that apply.

1. The MongoDB primary does not write to its data files until a majority acknowledgement comes back from the rest of the cluster.  When 27003 was primary, it did not perform the last 3 writes.
2. When 27003 came back up, it transmitted its write ops that the other member had not yet seen so that it would also have them.
3. MongoDB preserves the order of writes in a collection in its consistency model.  In this problem, 27003's oplog was effectively a "fork" and to preserve write ordering a rollback was necessary during 27003's recovery phase.
