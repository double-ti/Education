# Homework 3.2

## Problem

For this homework, you will need to use version 3.2 or later of MongoDB.

In a mongo shell run homework.b(). This will run in an infinite loop printing some output as it runs various statements against the server.

We'll now imagine that on this system a user has complained of slowness and we suspect there is a slow operation running. Find the slow operation and terminate it.

In order to do this, you'll want to open a second window (or tab) and there, run a second instance of the mongo shell, with something like:
```
$ mongo --shell localhost/performance performance.js
```
Keep the other shell with homework.b() going while this is happening. Once you have eliminated the slow operation, run (on your second tab):
```
homework.c()
```
and enter the output below. Once you have it right and are ready to move on, ctrl-c (terminate) the shell that is still running the homework.b() function.

## Solution

### First tab of Mongo Console:
```sh
> homework.b()
```

### Second tab of Mongo Console:
```sh
> homework.c()
```
