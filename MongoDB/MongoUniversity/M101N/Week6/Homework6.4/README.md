# Homework 6.4

## Problem

You have a sharded system with three shards and have sharded the collections "students" in the "school" database across those shards. The output of sh.status() when connected to mongos looks like this:
```sh
mongos> sh.status()
--- Sharding Status ---
  sharding version: {
    "_id" : 1,
    "minCompatibleVersion" : 5,
    "currentVersion" : 6,
    "clusterId" : ObjectId("5531512ac723271f602db407")
}
  shards:
    {  "_id" : "s0",  "host" : "s0/localhost:37017,localhost:37018,localhost:37019" }
    {  "_id" : "s1",  "host" : "s1/localhost:47017,localhost:47018,localhost:47019" }
    {  "_id" : "s2",  "host" : "s2/localhost:57017,localhost:57018,localhost:57019" }

    Currently enabled:  yes

    Failed balancer rounds in last 5 attempts:  0
    Migration Results for the last 24 hours:
        2 : Success
        1 : Failed with error 'migration already in progress', from s0 to s1
  databases:
    {  "_id" : "admin",  "partitioned" : false,  "primary" : "config" }
    {  "_id" : "school",  "partitioned" : true,  "primary" : "s0" }
        school.students
            shard key: { "student_id" : 1 }
            chunks:
                s0  1
                s1  3
                s2  1
            { "student_id" : { "$minKey" : 1 } } -->> { "student_id" : 0 } on : s2 Timestamp(3, 0)
            { "student_id" : 0 } -->> { "student_id" : 2 } on : s0 Timestamp(3, 1)
            { "student_id" : 2 } -->> { "student_id" : 3497 } on : s1 Timestamp(3, 2)
            { "student_id" : 3497 } -->> { "student_id" : 7778 } on : s1 Timestamp(3, 3)
            { "student_id" : 7778 } -->> { "student_id" : { "$maxKey" : 1 } } on : s1 Timestamp(3, 4)
```
If you ran the query
```
use school
db.students.find({'student_id':2000})
```
Which shards would be involved in answering the query?

## Answer

s1
