Download and extract the handout.

Run it in Visual Studio, and to make sure that you've got everything set up, it will post a number at localhost:61245. You can view it in your browser.

Please input that number into the box below to demonstrate that you have Visual Studio set up.

There should be no characters except numbers, and perhaps a minus sign. Do not include spaces. Do not include a decimal place.
